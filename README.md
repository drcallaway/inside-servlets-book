# Inside Servlets Book

I decided to write Inside Servlets when I was attempting to port a custom web application framework written for the Netscape API (NSAPI) to the Servlet API. After scouring local bookstores and the web, I realized that there were no servlet books available. So why not be among the first to write one? Unfortunately, two other authors beat me to market. Inside Servlets, published by Addison-Wesley, was released shortly after Java Servlets by Example from Manning Publications and Java Servlet Programming from O'Reilly. Regardless, with interest in Java servlets just starting to boom in 1999, third to market was close enough to sell a lot of books (and the second edition did equally well).

## About the Book
**Inside Servlets: Server-Side Programming for the Java Platform**\
*Published by Addison-Wesley*

Java servlet technology, an integral part of the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform, Inc., has become the de facto standard for creating dynamic, data-driven Web applications. By conforming to the Java Servlet API, developers can guarantee that their server-side programs will run on any J2EE-compliant platform.

Written for the thousands of Web programmers, designers, and consultants who want to expand their repertoire of development tools or enhance their servlet programming skills, Inside Servlets provides exactly the information needed. It offers important background information on Web technologies, an inside look at Java servlet technology, a hands-on servlet tutorial, and a guide to advanced servlet programming for creating sophisticated, high-performance Web sites.

This Second Edition has been thoroughly updated to incorporate versions 2.2 and 2.3 of the Java Servlet Specification. In addition, the book has been expanded to provide in-depth coverage of such vital topics as security, JavaServer Pages, packaging and deployment, advanced database access techniques, and servlet troubleshooting.

You will find an introduction to Web technologies that explains such fundamentals as firewalls, proxy servers, sockets, HTTP, and MIME types. A servlet tutorial offers information on basic servlet structure, demonstrates how to write and run your first servlet, and previews the Servlet API. The book then moves on to advanced servlet concepts and techniques. Lastly, a complete reference to the Servlet API is provided.

Specific topics featured include:

* Writing thread-safe servlets
* Servlet debugging
* HTTP redirects
* Cookies and session management
* Server-side includes
* Request forwarding
* Servlet chaining
* Database access with JDBC
* Security and encryption
* JavaServer Pages (including custom tag libraries)
* Packaging and deployment
* Servlet troubleshooting
* Separating content from presentation using a servlet-based template framework
* Servlet filtering and application lifecycle events (introduced in Servlet API 2.3)

In addition, Inside Servlets contains an entire section devoted to real-world examples of servlets in action, with detailed explanations and complete source code. The CD-ROM accompanying this book contains the source code and compiled class files for all sample code; JRun 3.0 from Allaire; SevletExec 3.0 from New Atlanta Communications; Apache Tomcat 3.1 and 3.2; MySQL database and JDBC driver; JBuilder 4 from Borland; and many other valuable servlet development tools.

## First Edition
Here's the cover for the first edition. Personally, I like the picture on this cover better than the second edition. However, I guess that the publisher decided that the second edition should have a different look to it. Here's the [link on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201379635/002-8276520-9140066).

## Second Edition
Here is the cover of the second edition of Inside Servlets. This edition went through 3 printings. Here's the [link on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201709066/002-8276520-9140066).

## Book Reviews
Inside Servlets was well received by readers. Here are a few selected quotes from book reviews.

*Inside Servlets makes an great guide to servlet programming, and is very accessible - even if you've never written a server-side application in another language before. Providing you have some basic Java experience, you'll be servlet programming in no time. It even includes a CD, with all the code examples and sample software.* -- David Reilly

*Best book I have read in a long time. This is the best book I have read in a long time. It is clear that the author knows his subject well, AND !!! is able to communicate it in a way which is esay to understand and enjoyable to read. This book is superb. Congratulations to an excellent book. This is one of the rare ones.* -- Rene Schmitt

*This book will help you understand not only Servlets but also JSP and many other related topics that you need to know when building web pages using Java. As you will learn soon, a typical Java web application consists of 3 major components: Servlet, JSP, and JavaBean. You will need to master all 3 of them, and this book will help you learn the most important component of the 3: The Servlet. 10 stars to the author!* -- T. Trinh

*First rate! This book is just what a technical book should be. The exposition is clear and comprehensive; the layout-typesetting is very easy on the eyes; and the author has a pleasant though no nonsense style that makes this a pleasure to work with. The book provides good background material for the different topics it covers, without spoon feeding or "dumbing down." It goes on to cover advanced topics -- threads, JDBC, JSP -- decently. It doesn't try to be the "be all to end all" regarding these topics, but instead gives the reader a very solid introduction, and enough code to accomplish something worthwhile. I have this book, and the book from O'Reilly; and though I would recommend both, if I had to choose one, this book would win -- no contest!* -- Mario Diana

*I found this book to be a very good buy. The first few chapters that go over the basic principals behind the internet and web development were well written and informative. But I can see that a more senior developer will probably already know most of it. I usually have a hard time finding a book that falls in the middle between novice user and hard core expericended developer But with this book, it hits the middle spot perfectly. I'm currently developing using jsp's and servlets and this book has been a good reference to me as well.* -- Luc Richard

*Without knowing much about internet programming or servlets, with this book I was able to get up to speed quickly on both subjects. It includes an excellent review of internet technologies as well as great coverage of servlets and JSP. And, unlike some books I've seen, all of the code examples actually compile and run!* -- Jason Simpson

*The book covers detailed analysis on servlets programming and interfacing with database. It clearly explains each concept that is essential for programming with Servlets. I feel, this is a must-read book for medium level programmers for acquiring a high degree of programming prowess in order to become veterans.* -- Murali R.V

*Great book. Period. This is an excellent book that gets your hands dirty and gets you going in writing simple servlets in a matter of hours. The examples are short and best of all they work.* -- Raad Yacu

*The author has a great style and the book gives us a very good introduction to the Web world with not easy to find information.* -- Mario de Sa Vara
